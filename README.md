# Human Interaction Templates
This repository houses instructional guides, Markdown templates, and text documents that I've crafted in the service of interacting well with other people.  All creations are my original works, but as with most creative endeavors, these are the amalgamation of all my past life experiences, tips shared by generous mentors, and inspirational works of others.

## Motivations
I use a host of Markdown and text-based templates for my work at GitHub. In the spirit of open source, and sharing more than just traditional programming language code, I've chosen to open source this set of materials.

## Contributions
I'd welcome any modest enhancements through pull requests, but large-scale changes might be best suited to be implemented in a fork of this repository.
