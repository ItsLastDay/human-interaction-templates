# Human Interaction Templates
This repository houses instructional guides, Markdown templates, and text documents that I've crafted in the service of interacting well with other people.  All creations are my original works, but as with most creative endeavors, these are the amalgamation of all my past life experiences, tips shared by generous mentors, and inspirational works of others.

## Attribution
I have attempted to reach out to anyone that inspired a work and asked if they want to be credited publicly in the artifact either by full name or by initials. I will default to initials where appropriate. PRs, Issues, or emails are always welcome to further attribute past works.

## Motivations
I use a host of Markdown and text-based templates for my work at GitHub. In the spirit of open source, and sharing more than just traditional programming language code, I've chosen to open source this set of materials.

## Contributions
I'd welcome any modest enhancements through pull requests, but large-scale changes might be best suited to be implemented in a fork of this repository.
