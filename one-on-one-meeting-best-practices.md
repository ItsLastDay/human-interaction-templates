## Leverage templates 📄

- [Matthew's 1:1 template document](one-on-one-minimal-template.md)
- [Weekly snippets template](weekly-snippets.md)

## Build context 🔍

- Look up a user's latest work through a universal search
- Reflect on recent chat and email exchanges
- Prepare an agenda in advance

## Keep it speedy 🏃

- Use [Google's Speedy Meetings](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/work-hacks-from-g-suite-how-to-host-more-effective-meetings#:~:text=also%20choose%20the%20%E2%80%9C-,Speedy%20meetings,-%E2%80%9D%20option%20in%20your) preference to default to 25m or 50m meeting lengths
- Book as little time as needed ([15m is ok](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/15-minute-meeting-burnout#:~:text=15%2Dminute%20meeting%2C%20organizational%20psychologist%20Steven%20Rogelberg%20points%20out%20that%20shorter%2C%20more%20focused%20meetings%20are%20old%20hat)) for an efficient conversation
- Not every meeting needs warmup; feel free to dive right in to the intended conversation

## Be agreeable 🤗

- Calibrate to each others' preferences for meeting times, formats, and preparation
- Document preferences for communicating, perhaps through a [Human User Guide](human-user-guide.md) like [Matthew's](examples/human-user-guide-for-matthew.md)

## Remain flexible 🧭

- Make 1:1 calendar invites editable by all parties
- Demonstrate that 1:1s are more important than other meetings through minimal reschduling
- Always prefer reschduling 1:1s over canceling
