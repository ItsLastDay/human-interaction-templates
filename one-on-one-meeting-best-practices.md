# 1:1 Meeting Best Practices

## Spark ideas 🧠

- Ask useful questions
- Reflect on what effective one to one conversations look like
- Be curious

## Leverage templates 📄

- [Matthew's 1:1 template document](one-on-one-minimal-template.md)
- [Weekly snippets template](weekly-snippets.md)
- [Human user guide template](human-user-guide.md)

## Build context 🔍

- Look up a user's latest work through a universal search
- Reflect on recent chat and email exchanges
- Prepare an agenda in advance

## Keep it speedy 🏃

- Use Google's Speedy Meetings preference to default to 25m or 50m meeting lengths
- Book as little time as needed (15m is ok) for an efficient conversation
- Not every meeting needs warmup; feel free to dive right in to the intended conversation

## Be agreeable

- Calibrate to each others' preferences for meeting times, formats, and preparation
- Document preferences for communicating, perhaps through a [Human User Guide](human-user-guide.md) like [Matthew's](examples/human-user-guide-for-matthew.md)

## Remain flexible

- Make calendar invites editable by all parties
- Aim to keep 1:1s sacred, and only modified if unavoidable
- Prefer reschduling over canceling
